# CSharpTools

Currently developing C# to generate a MockBuilder (using moq) by reading out an interface

A nice article on MockBuilders: https://medium.com/webcom-engineering-and-product/a-cleaner-way-to-create-mocks-in-net-6e039c3d1db0 

The solution is structured using the Microsoft DDD Conventions. The C# code is generated using the roslyn API.
